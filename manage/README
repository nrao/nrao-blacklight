Simple code for building a Solr instance.

post.py is a simple script to post documents to Solr using pysolr.
post.py uses `from docs import docs` so build docs.py to have a docs
which is a list of dictionaries for use with pysolr.

See example.docs.py and example.data.csv for an example of building docs.
