We have developed a cartridge-type receiver which receives two orthogonal polarizations and down-converts the sideband separated signals to intermediate frequencies (IF) between 4 and 8 Wiz. A vvaveguide polarization splitter or ortho-mode transducer (OMT) has been developed, which enables the cryogenic optics quite simple. It achieved low loss of-O.4 dB at 4 K and polarization isolation of -25 dB in 385 - 500 GHz [1]. A sideband separating mixer consists of two DSB Nb-based SIS mixers and vvaveguide quadrature coupler [2]. The receiver noise temperature was less than 8 hf/k or 196 K in SSl3 and the image rejection ratio of > 10 dB in the 90 % of ALMA Band 8 frequency. Gain compression of this receiver was measured. The amplitude and phase stabilities were confirmed to comply the ALMA specifications. The co-polar and cross polar beam patterns of this receiver were measured in five frequencies [3]. Test results of S/N 01 cartridge will be presented."

Each beam enters a corrugated feed horn attached to a double-side-band (DSB) mixer block. The mixer uses a full-height waveguide and an NbTiN- or NbN-based superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer chip. We are testing the following three types of mixer chips: 1) Nb SIS junctions + NbTiN/SiO2/Al tuning circuits on a quartz substrate, 2) Nb SIS junctions + NbN/SiO2/Al tuning circuits on an MgO substrate, and 3) NbN SIS junctions + NbN or NbTiN tuning circuits on an MgO substrate.

The isolated port of the LO coupler is terminated by wideband floating elliptical termination. The mixer employs two SIS junctions with junction area of 3 micro m2 each, in the twin junction configuration, followed by a quarter wave transformer to match the RF probe. 2SB mixer uses two identical but mirrored chips, whereas each DSB mixer has the same end-piece configuration.

Two schemes were used to tune out junction's parasitic capacitance. When a parallel inductor is employed, the input impedance is close to Rn, which facilitates impedance matching between the junction and the waveguide probe. Waveguide probes were designed to achieve a low feed-point impedance to match to the junction resistance. Optimum embedding impedances for lower receiver noise temperature were investigated. Performances of two schemes and composition of receiver noise were also discussed."

The mixer uses an array of 0.24 micro m2 Nb/Al-AlN/NbTiN SIS junctions with critical current density of 30-50 KA/cm2. The junctions are shaped in order to optimize the suppression of the Josephson DC currents. We are using a double slot planar antenna to couple the mixer chip with the telescope beam. The RF matching microcircuit is made using Nb and gold films. The mixer IF circuit is designed to cover 4 - 8 GHz band. A test receiver with the new mixer has a low noise operation in a 0.87 - 1.12 THz band. The minimum DSB receiver noise measured at 1 THz is 260 K (Y=1.64), apparently the lowest reported up to date. The receiver noise corrected for the loss in the LO injection beam splitter and in the cryostat window is 200 K. The combination of a broad operation band of about 250 GHz with a low receiver noise is making the new mixer a useful element for application at SOFIA. We will discuss the prospective of a further improvement of the sensitivity and extension of the upper frequency of operation of SIS mixer."
"2009037000","Terahertz Local Oscillator Sources","T.W. Crowe, J.L. Hesler, W.L. Bishop, G.S. Schoenthal, and K. Hui","Crowe",NULL,"M3","37","0","2009","High quality local oscillator sources are required for astronomical receivers throughout the terahertz frequency range. This paper is focused on the development of sources for frequencies greater than 1 THz for use with Hot Electron Bolometric (HEB) mixers, specifically on the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). One of the great advantages of HEB mixers is their very low LO power requirements, of order one microwatt per pixel (including coupling losses). However, the challenges of achieving even this power level at such high frequency remain significant, and the goals for significant tuning bands to enhance the measurement capability of the receiver are formidable. Also, there is great interest in developing array receivers, which will increase the required power level by a factor of ten. VDI's terahertz sources are based on high power amplifiers, typically near 40GHz, and a series of frequency multipliers that translate the power to higher frequency, albeit with very significant losses. For example, three years ago VDI (in collaboration with SRON) presented a 1.3THz source that generated of order 10uW and was electronically tunable over 100GHz of bandwidth. This source used an amp/x2x2x3x3 configuration, where the doublers were high power varactors and the triplers were broadband varistor multipliers. In fact, the triplers were shown to operate with similar performance across the entire waveguide band (1.1-1.7THz) without any tuning whatsoever. These same triplers have been used to generate greater than 30uW, when stronger driver components have been used. More recently VDI has focused on the 1.9 and 2.7THz bands that are of interest for the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies, which is being developed by the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Radioastronomie (MPIfR) and the Universitaet zu Koeln for use on the SOFIA aircraft. At 1.9 THz VDI has delivered an initial LO chain that generates a few microwatts of power, which is marginally sufficient to pump the receiver when the coupling losses into the dewar are included. In this paper VDI will describe this LO chain and the ongoing efforts to increase the output power by an order of magnitude for use on a future receiver array. The 2.7 THz frequency band is significantly more challenging, owing to the increased inefficiency of Schottky multipliers at the higher frequency. The goal is to generate enough power for a single pixel receiver with significant frequency tuning. To date VDI has demonstrated the required driver module at 300GHz and is presently working on an improved tripler to 900GHz. The final tripler to 2.7THz has been designed and is awaiting fabrication. First results for the new components are expected to be available in time for the conference presentation."

The Schottky diodes are widely employed for developing of multipliers, mixers and detectors of THz  frequency range. However, for a successful operation in the THz region, it is necessary to increase cutoff frequency of Schottky diodes that has proven quite difficult due to fundamental restrictions (high inertness of electron pass through an active zone and parasitic capacitances). Use of superlattice structures are expected to be more effective for frequency transformation since the lower values of inertness and parasitic capacitances and presence of negative differential conductivity (up to 1 THz) on the volt-ampere characteristic. In the report we present high stable tunable radiation sources (frequency synthesizers and generator of harmonics), operating up to 6.3 THz. It is based on solid-state Gunn generator (97.5-117.5 GHz) and frequency multiplier on superlattice structures. Spectral parameters of generated harmonics are investigated.

However, many challenges must still be addressed for QCLs to become practical THz sources. Among these challenges are to shape the highly divergent and non-Gaussian output beam patterns observed from QCLs into a more useful and predictable beam shape, and to integrate QCLs into the existing, broadly used THz technical infrastructure. To address both the beam pattern problem and integrability/manufacturability issues we have developed a lithographic method to microfabricate small, single mode rectangular waveguide structures on-a chip. To explore the performance of the waveguides as well as the integration with active THz lasers, we have tested both stand-alone waveguides and waveguides integrated on-chip with THz quantum cascade lasers. The 75 micron wide by 37 micron tall waveguide structures were designed to be single mode between 2 and 4 THz, and were fabricated using patterned electroplating of thick gold sidewalls around a photoresist form, followed by electroplating of a gold lid, and lastly removal of the polymer form by solvation. The waveguides were coupled to free space using 2-dimenstional H-plane horn flares. Measurements on stand-alone waveguides with different lengths revealed a loss of 1.4 +/- 0.15 dB/mm corresponding to 0.14 db/lambda. This is roughly a factor of two higher than HFSS models predict for perfect gold walls, but it still compares favorably to 0.2 db/lambda at 100 GHz and 0.6 db/lambda at 300 GHz for commercially available waveguides. Initial beam pattern measurements yielded qualitative data in agreement with predictions, but displayed strong high-spatial frequency amplitude oscillations. Recent measurements have identified the cause of this oscillation as being due to interference between alternate paths between the horn and detector resulting from reflections of intermediate optics. New beam pattern measurements eliminating the reflections will be presented. We have also successfully fabricated the rectangular waveguides directly onto a chip containing multiple THz QCLs. Even though thermal stress issues caused by the need to cool the lasers resulted in a high failure rate in initial designs, we have observed QCL emission from the horns of single-spatial-mode integrated waveguides, some using only 0.2 W of input power at threshold."

TELIS is mounted together with the MIPAS-B2 instrument on a balloon platform of the Institute for Meteorology and Climate Research of the University of Karlsruhe (IMK, Germany). TELIS can observe both in the sub-millimeter range (480-650 GHz) and at 1.8 THz, while MIPAS-B2 observes trace-gases in the thermal infrared. Results will be used to refine and constrain numerical chemical transport models. The SRON contribution to TELIS is the 480-650 GHz Superconducting Integrated Receiver (SIR) channel. This is a unique superconducting on-chip heterodyne receiver, consisting of a double dipole antenna, a SIS mixer, a flux-flow Local Oscillator, and a superconducting harmonic mixer used for phase locking of the LO-signal. The bandwidth of the Digital Autocorrelator IF-backend of the SIR-receiver channel is 2 GHz, centered at 6 GHz. The lowest noise temperature of the receiver is 120 K DSB, measured over the full IF bandwidth. Although the concept of an integrated receiver has been explored for some years, the actual use of such a receiver for scientific observations so far has not been demonstrated. The first flight campaign with TELIS/MIPAS was in June 2008 from Teresina (Brazil). The SIR channel was operating well during the 2 hour ascent, but a major problem with the TELIS cryostat occurred at flight altitude (40 km) and this prevented scientific data retrieval. A second flight of TELIS is scheduled early 2009 from Kiruna (Sweden). This flight will focus on the Arctic ozone chemistry. The actual flight date depends on the occurrence of favourable meterological conditions.

While single-band imaging surveys have now revealed hundreds of SMGs, further progress will require multi-band information in order to measure spectral indices and luminosities and for selecting objects for targeted follow-up observations, e.g. with ALMA. The first steps in this direction are already being taken: the 10m South Pole Telescope is finding galaxies at 150 GHz and 220 GHz using TES bolometer array cameras, and the BLAST balloon instrument has made galaxy surveys at 250, 350, and 500 microns. Ultimately, surveys with bigger telescopes (such as the proposed 25m CCAT) equipped with large multiband imagers will be needed. As a step toward this ultimate goal, we are constructing MKIDCam, a 576 spatial pixel 4-band (750, 850, 1100, 1300 microns) camera to be deployed at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) in 2010. The focal plane arrays, optics, readout electronics, and cryogenics are currently under development. The focal plane will consist of 24 x 24 spatial pixels responding simultaneously to all four bands and assembled as a mosaic of 16 tiles. Each 6 x 6 pixel tile will have 144 frequency-multiplexed Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs). Individual pixels consist of a phased-array planar antenna, on-chip filters for band separation, and four MKIDs for simultaneous measurement of the four bands. The MKID readout will be performed using cryogenic HEMT amplifiers followed by room-temperature FPGA-based channelization electronics. At present, tests on prototype 4x4 two-band arrays are being performed and critical properties such as responsivity, noise, quasiparticle lifetime, optical efficiency, optical bandpass response, and magnetic field sensitivity are being measured. The MKID resonators show excess frequency noise due to perturbations in the dielectric constant of a surface layer containing two-level system (TLS) fluctuators. Based on a semi-empirical TLS noise model, we have designed and fabricated new resonators using modified geometries such as interdigitated capacitors. Measurements of these devices have confirmed a reduction in frequency noise by roughly an order of magnitude compared to our previous conventional CPW resonators. These results suggest that the optically-loaded frequency-readout NEP for these devices could be appropriate for reaching the photon background limit at the CSO (5 - 15x10-17 W Hz-1/2). A second engineering run with a 6x6 pixel 3-band array prototype camera incorporating the new lower noise resonator designs is planned at the CSO in 2009."

The output electrical noise measured in these devices in the voltage-bias mode with a low-noise (~ 2 pA/Hz1/2) dc SQUID amplifier was completely dominated by the thermal energy fluctuations (phonon noise). The corresponding electrical NEP was in the range (2-7)x10-18 W/Hz1/2 depending on the detector device size. The time constant of these devices was too short to be measured directly with the available SQUID readout electronics and is estimated to be of the order of a microns or less. Beside the record low NEP, the ultimately small nanobolometers have a very low electron heat capacitance that makes them promising for detecting single THz photons. The larger devices studied in this work were tested using NIR photons (wavelength 1550 nm). Depending on the average number of photons per pulse, a typical Poisson-like statistics of counts has been observed. The photon numbers greater than 2 were, however, difficult to observe since the detector output was almost saturated by just a single photon of this wavelength. The minimum detectable energy for these devices is estimated to be about hx5THz. The on-going effort is aimed at fabrication of the antenna-coupled detector devices and direct optical measurements of the NEP at 650 GHz. A setup for single THz photon detection utilizing a pulsed quantum cascade laser is also being built. The progress in these areas will be reported during the meeting."

Therefore among all the requirements, a crucial one is the sensitivity, which should reach an NEP (Noise Equivalent Power) as low as 2x10-19 W/[square root]Hz at an operating temperature of 50 mK. TES detectors are used or planned in many ground-based telescopes in addition to airborne, balloon-borne, and space-borne instruments.

It is demonstrated that calculated dc I-V curves agree well with those of the SIS junctions measured at temperatures below 4.2 K. It is predicted that the subgap current is strongly dependent on bias voltage at low temperatures unlike the prediction of the BCS tunneling theory. It is also interesting to note that the decrease of a subgap current always saturates at a certain temperature when the temperature goes down. These predictions on the subgap current at low temperatures are consistent with the behavior of the subgap current of SIS junctions experimentally obtained. It is indicated that it is essential to suppress the lifetime broadening of energy gap as low as possible to invent SIS junctions with an extremely low subgap current at low temperatures."

In this paper we present the development of a 400 pixel MKID demonstration array, including optical coupling, sensitivity measurements, beam pattern measurements and readout. The design presented can be scaled to any frequency between 80 GHz and >5 THz because there is no need for superconducting structures that become lossy at frequencies above the gap frequency of the materials used. The latter would limit the frequency coverage to below 1 THz for relatively high gap materials such as NbTiN. An individual pixels of the array consist of a distributed Aluminium CPW MKID with an integrated twin slot antenna at its end. The antenna is placed in the in the second focus of an elliptical high purity Si lens. The lens-antenna coupling design allows room for the MKID resonator outside of the focal point of the lens. The best  dark noise equivalent power of these devices is measured to be NEP = 7x10-19 W/[square root]Hz and the optical coupling efficiency is around 30%, in which no antireflection coating was used on the Si lens.

In the absence of significant optical depth the intensities of Doppler limited lines are linearly proportional to the total column. For insitu applications a microwave source illuminates the gas and power is measured as a function of frequency allowing the comparatively narrow lines to be detected even when there is significant gain or power structure. The illuminating source can easily have a brightness temperature greater than 1014K so that extremely weak features can be detected. The result is that rotational techniques facilitate extremely sensitive chemical identification and have the potential for very accurate total abundance determination.

The feeds to these bolometers utilise corrugated horns with novel features which meet with two important performance requirements: very low sidelobes, to avoid uncontrolled signal contamination and high pass filtering to control the fields presented to the Radial Probe detectors. The former is provide by a design, developed by Graham Smith in St. Andrews, to deliberately excite HE12 higher order modes in a sine-square profile section of the horn, followed by an extended parallel section designed to bring the HE12 mode into phase with the dominate HE11 mode. Surprisingly wide bandwidths - at the 30% level - with sidelobes well below minus 35dB are achieved. Analysis shows that close to 99.88% of the transmitted power (in a time reversed view) is in the fundamental Gaussian free space mode - hence the term, Ultra-Gaussian horn. The later is provide by a filter section close to the transition into the detector module. The suppression of leaks well below the nominal HE11 cut-off provided an interesting computational and experimental challenge, requiring significant modelling effort in both HFSS and more traditional Mode Matching programs.

More recently scientists have considered long-duration missions to study the atmospheres of other planets, particularly Venus and Mars, as well as the atmospheres of the major moons of the gas giant planets. Of particular interest is the proposed Vesper mission to Venus which would use heterodyne receivers in the frequency band from about 440-590GHz. Schottky receivers are ideal for such a mission because they achieve the required sensitivity without any need for cooling and can be easily tuned across very significant frequency bands. Through a NASA SBIR project (Contract NNX09CA57C), VDI is developing an improved mixer technology that would be optimal for Vesper and other similar missions. Specifically, VDI is striving to simplify the Vesper receiver through the development Schottky receivers that can be tuned across the entire waveguide band without any mechanical or bias adjustments. For Vesper VDI proposes the use of a subharmonically pumped mixer that operates in the WR-1.9 waveguide band (400-600GHz). This mixer requires no bias and the Phase 1 study has shown that excellent sensitivity (Tmix ~ 1,000-2,000K, DSB) can be achieved across a very broad frequency band with only 1-2mW of LO power. In Phase 2 VDI will co-design the mixer and LO multipliers to achieve a receiver system that allows tuning of the LO frequency across the required Vesper band with no adjustments other than the frequency of the input oscillator, while maintaining the sensitivity noted above and potentially reducing the required LO power level. The presentation will review that performance of this mixer design, with emphasis on the work being done to achieve full waveguide band performance and discussion of the development of the LO oscillator chain."

To reach the ultimate receiver noise temperatures in the high end of the THz range (3-6 THz), it is crucial to understand their fundamental noise contribution from different origins. With increasing frequency, the classical output noise contribution should remain unchanged, but the quantum noise contribution is expected to play an increasing role [1]. This paper reports the first dedicated experiment using a single NbN HEB mixer at a number of local oscillator frequencies between 1.6 to 4.3 THz to address and quantify the contribution of the quantum noise to the receiver noise temperature. We used a spiral antenna coupled NbN HEB mixer with a bolometer size of 2 micron x 0.2 micron. In order to minimize uncertainties in the corrections of the optical losses, we use a vacuum hot/cold load setup [2] to eliminate the air loss, and an uncoated elliptical Si lens. Although other components, a 3 micron Mylar beam splitter and a QMC heat filter, also introduce frequency dependent optical losses, they can be accurately calibrated. Furthermore, to reduce uncertainties in the data, we measure Y-factors responding to the hot/cold load by fixing the voltage, but varying the LO power. As LO, we use a FIR gas laser. We measure the Y-factor at the optimal point at different frequencies by only varying LO frequencies, but keeping the rest exactly the same. We obtain DSB receiver noise temperatures, which are 842 K (at 1.6 THz), 845 K (1.9 THz), 974 K (2.5 THz) and 1372 K (4.3 THz). After the correction for the losses of the QMC filter and the beam splitter, the noise data show a linear increase with increasing frequency. Using a quantum noise model for HEB mixers and using a criterion for which the classical output noise must be constant at different frequencies, we analyze the results and find the excess quantum noise factor Beta to be around 2 and that 24 % of the total receiver noise temperature at 4.3 THz (at the input of the entire receiver) can be ascribed to quantum noise. Clearly the quantum noise has a small but measurable effect on the receiver noise temperature at this frequency. We are still analyzing different alternatives of interpretation for the mismatch loss between the bolometer and the spiral antenna."

In particular this is mandatory for astronomical measurements in the THz frequency range. We present test receiver measurements of several NbTiN THz SHEB waveguide mixers in combination with a newly available 0.3-4 GHz cryogenic low noise amplifier (LNA) based on discrete SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistors. This SiGe LNA is especially suitable for SHEB mixer IF amplification because of its multi-octave bandwidth at low frequencies and low input reflection coefficient. As a result - contrary to current approach for stable SHEB receiver operation - neither an isolator nor a balanced LNA configuration for suppression of the reflected IF power at the amplifier input is required. An isolator severely limits the relative IF bandwidth to less than one octave and balanced amplifiers are too bulky for future array applications, even if one could accommodate the additional dissipation. We investigate the IF frequency response of the test receiver with regard to output power stability (i.e. Allan times), ripple and receiver noise and demonstrate that this receiver configuration is suitable for astronomical operation. With these LNAs the 1.4 THz and 1.9 THz SHEB receiver channels of the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies (GREAT) for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) and the balloon-borne Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory (STO) will get a substantial enlargement of available IF bandwidth."

One aircraft will generate multiple tones near the 22 GHz water line and 183 GHz to 204 GHz absorption lines and transmit them across the Earth's limb through the atmosphere to receivers on a second aircraft. Flight paths of the two aircraft begin over the horizon, with the two aircraft flying at 65 kft altitude. This creates a rising occultation geometry as the aircraft fly towards each other. ATOMMS provides the sensitivity, resolution and accuracy needed to satisfy key monitoring needs for temperature, pressure, moisture and ozone. The 100 to 200 m ATOMMS vertical resolution will far surpass the 1 to 4 km vertical resolution of present state-of-the-art satellite radiometers opening a window into atmospheric scales previously inaccessible from space. Predicted precisions of individual ATOMMS temperature, pressure and moisture profiles are unprecedented at ~0.4 K, 0.1% and 1-3% respectively, extending from near the surface to the flight altitude of ~20 km. ATOMMS ozone profiles precise to 1-3% will extend from the upper troposphere well into the mesosphere. Other trace constituents such as water isotopes can be measured with performance similar to that of ozone. The ATOMMS experiment is a pathfinder experiment for eventual implementation on a constellation of satellites. Space observations from multiple satellites in precessing orbits will allow for global spatial coverage and increased altitude coverage. Our long term goal is a constellation of approximately a dozen small spacecraft making ATOMMS measurements that will provide dense, global coverage and complete cloud-penetration and diurnal sampling every orbit. The ATOMMS instrument packages are now being tested and assembled, with expected flight series in spring and early summer, 2009."

For efficient LO pumping of the sideband separating mixer, a novel high power LO chain based on a 5 x 34 GHz HBV quintupler (170 GHz LO source) has been developed with an ultra compact mechanical block housing, not much larger then a waveguide flange. We have also looked into a broadband medium LO power source consisting of a W-band active multiplier module, based on commercial MMIC chips from Hittite, followed by a medium power Schottky doubler from VDI. The demonstrated compact receiver front end has a considerably reduced size and weight owing to the high multiplication factor of the compact LO chain and mixer with integrated LNA. The novel sideband separating topology that uses 90 degree hybrids for both LO and RF resolves the standing wave issue of a previously proposed topology, in which a matched Y-junction was used as an RF hybrid and a branch guide coupler with a 45 degree differential line phase shifter at the output, was used for the LO feeding. The proposed topology improves both the sideband suppression and reduces the standing waves at the LO and RF ports."

Hesler","Duan",NULL,"W4","190","0","2009","One of the major challenges of creating terahertz systems for radio astronomy and other applications is the lack of suitable test and measurement equipment. Over the past several decades researchers have developed and demonstrated broadband mixers and multipliers based on Schottky diodes that have been used primarily for scientific applications throughout this frequency band. As the performance of these basic components has improved and particularly as their tuning bandwidth has increased, it becomes possible to develop effective frequency extenders for standard test equipment, such as Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs) and Spectrum Analyzers (SAs). VDI's first effort in this area was in collaboration with ESA for the development of a VNA extender for their antenna test range in Noordwijk (see paper presented at the AMTA conference in St. Louis, Nov. 2007). For that effort VDI developed transmitter and receiver extenders to the WR6.5 and WR4.3 waveguide bands for a Rohde & Schwarz ZVA 40. These systems achieved transmit powers of ~0-5dBm and dynamic range in the range of 80-100dB across the waveguide bands. VDI is now developing a modular VNA extender system that will allow measurements across the frequency range from about 140 GHz through 1 THz, and eventually higher. The modular nature of the system allows the same lower frequency components, such as the LO and transmitter W-Band drivers, to be reused as additional frequency multipliers are added to move to higher frequency bands. Through the gradual improvement of the individual components, as well as the system design, VDI has recently demonstrated excellent performance (DR ~80dB) in the WR1.5 waveguide band. This talk will review the development of the modular VNA frequency extender system and present recent results for frequencies in the range from 500GHz through 1.5 THz."

Stuber","Murk",NULL,"W4","202","0","2009","We present a new digital back-end for Correlation and Spectrum Analysis (COSPAN), which will be used for remote sensing of the atmosphere and radio astronomy. Its hardware is based on a commercially available signal analyzer Acqiris AC240 from Agilent, which provides two input channels with 1GS/s sampling rate and an on-board FPGA signal processor. The original FFT firmware of this instrument allows to accumulate a total power spectrum with 1GHz bandwidth and 16384 channels (61kHz resolution) in real-time for a single input channel. Our new COSPAN firmware processes the data from both input channels in two separate FFT pipelines, which results in two 500MHz wide complex spectra with 30.5kHz resolution. These spectra can be then combined or analyzed by different user modes. The most straight forward one is the total power mode where the real and imaginary part is squared and added for each spectrum separately. This mode could be used, for example, to process two pixels of an array receiver. In the correlation mode the real and imaginary part of the product of the two spectra is accumulated, which corresponds to the complex cross-correlation spectrum of the two inputs. This mode has been implemented for our new 22GHz correlation receiver MIAWARA-C, in which the atmospheric signal and a reference signal from an active cold load are combined with an 3dB hybrid coupler and processed in two identical receiver chains. With the correlation mode the two input signals are continuously compared with each other, whereas the uncorrelated noise of the two receivers does not contribute to the accumulated spectra. As a result gain fluctuations are less critical and the stability of the instrument is highly improved. Another application area for the correlation mode are polarimetric observations. The third image rejection mode calculates the total powers of the sum and the difference of the two complex FFT spectra after applying an appropriate phase shift. When the two input channels are fed by an IQ Mixer the two resulting spectra represent the lower and the upper sideband. This mode is the equivalent to a conventional sideband separating mixer in which which the two IFs are combined by an analog hybrid coupler, but it provides a higher image rejection because the digital 90 degree phase shift is more accurate. To further improve the image rejection COSPAN allows to determine and correct the amplitude unbalance of the IQ mixer."

The ALMA band 10 receiver front-end is currently under development. In this paper we introduce a novel concept of Local Oscillator (LO) injection scheme. Three solutions were studied for the band 10 receiver LO injection system. The first solution being investigated was a full waveguide scheme which main characteristic was to have the LO source (pair of triplers devices) connected to each other by an oversized waveguide. The first multiplier was located in the 110K thermal stage and the second tripler into the 4K thermal stage. The mixer then received the LO power from a waveguide 10 dB coupler connected to the 792-955GHz signal output. This scheme was tested and demonstrated to suffer of large standing waves, which eventually made the mixing process impossible due to lack of LO pumping power at some frequencies of band 10. The use of a double mirror coupling system together with a beam splitter for quasi-optical LO power injection was also investigated. However mechanical constrains made this design not practicable. The current design implies the use of a double mirror coupling system which purpose is to couple two identical horns in a so called horn-to-horn scheme. The 10 dB power coupler is then used for power injection to the mixer chip. The design and software analysis of the total power coupling between the two horns will be presented in this paper. Some initial measurements of beam pattern and total power being transmitted from horn to horn will be shown aiming at the concept validation for the nominal design room temperature."

This adds an additional symmetry plane that simplifies the computational cost of the circuit simulations since just half of the structure can be simulated by defining a perfect H-plane boundary condition at the symmetry plane.

Such feedhorn arrays are popular since they offer the high aperture efficiencies, low sidelobes, low stray light sensitivities and low-cross polarisations required for many astronomical applications. The problem of fabricating large numbers of high quality feeds at a low cost is becoming increasingly acute, and the cost of horn array fabrication is rapidly becoming a large fraction of the total instrument cost. In previous work, we have described novel multi-flare angled smooth-walled horns designed using a genetic algorithm. These horns have one or two flare-angle discontinuities and promise to be much easier to machine than corrugated horns at sub-mm wavelengths and yet offer similar radiation patterns. We have previously measured very good beam patterns for electroformed prototypes of these horns across a 17% bandwidth at 230 GHz. In this paper, we describe our fabrication process for these horns by direct machining into a block of aluminium using shaped drill bits. This is a new fabrication technique and is very rapid compared to the electroforming or direct machining of corrugated horns. We describe the construction of prototype 230 GHz horns using this technique and present experimentally measured beam patterns.

Radiometry provides valuable information on the distribution and dynamics of molecules such as H2O, NO2 and NO2, as well as information on atmospheric temperature and cloud water content. Given that radiometer's receivers usually share a common main antenna, FSS are critical frequency demultiplexing components and demands on their performance in terms of insertion loss and isolation of unwanted channels are stringent. The reported FSS have some common features: they have a very low insertion loss, operate for a range of angles of incidence around 45o, have near-identical behaviour for both TE and TM incident polarizations, and their performance is accurately modelled using Ansoft HFSS or CST Microwave Studio. Both structures have also satisfactorily passed preliminary space qualification trials. The first FSS, designed for a proposed millimetre wave meteorological instrument, operates in low pass mode to separate a transmitted channel at (31.40 plus or minus 0.09) GHz from a reflection band between 50.2 and 55.7 GHz. It comprises of rectangular patterns of 1.6 mm diameter copper rings produced by photolithography on both sides of a 1.575 mm thick PTFE/glass dielectric sheet. The FSS was designed and optimised using HFSS. The FSS transmission loss at 31.4 GHz was measured as 0.3 dB, whereas reflection loss in the band centred on 53 GHz was found to be 0.2 dB or less. The second FSS, destined for a limb sounding radiometer, operates at sub-millimetre wavelengths to separate the signal and image bands of a double sideband mixer. The filter consists of two identical, 30 mm diameter, 12.5 micron thick, optically flat, freestanding perforated metal screens separated by 450 micron. Each of the ~ 5000 micromachined unit cells contains two nested, short circuited, rectangular loop slots and a rectangular dipole slot. Careful optimisation of the shapes of these elements, plus the interactions between the adjacent screens, allows nearly coincident spectral responses to be obtained for both polarisations. The FSS transmission was measured using an ABmm vector network analyser and a quasi-optical test bench. The insertion loss over the transmitted 316.5 - 325.5 GHz signal band was 0.6 dB or less: rejection greater than or equal to 30 dB was achieved in the 349.5 - 358.5 GHz image band. Results are in excellent agreement with the CST predictions. Such a dual polarisation performance, with a band edge frequency ratio of 1.07, has not previously been reported."

Prober","Santavicca",NULL,"P3","238","0","2009","Testing a single-photon-sensitive THz detector poses significant technical challenges, especially for a bolometric detector. The challenge is the very low background required over a frequency range dc to several THz. In addition, the thermal conductance due to photons must be made less than that due to phonons. To enable device optimization prior to developing a full THz test system, we propose an alternative testing technique that is much easier to implement. A short microwave pulse with a total energy equal to a single THz photon is coupled to the detector. The microwave coupling can be precisely calibrated, and the detector can be well isolated from background IR photons. We call this microwave test pulse a faux photon, or fauxton. We use a 20 GHz source with a pulse width of 200 ns. The pulse width is much shorter than the thermal time constant of the detector (~5 micro seconds). The energy of the fauxton can be changed simply by adjusting the amplitude of the microwave source, equivalent to adjusting the THz single-photon frequency. The detector response is determined from the change in the power reflection coefficient measured with a 1.3 GHz CW probe. This readout technique is well suited to frequency-domain multiplexing of a multi-pixel detector array. The detector consists of a superconducting Ti nanobridge 4 micron long, 0.4 micron wide, and 70 nm thick with a critical temperature (Tc) of 300 mK. The nanobridge spans thick Nb contacts, which have a higher Tc and hence create Andreev barriers that block the outdiffusion of hot electrons from the nanobridge. The resulting bolometer is phononcooled, with a thermal conductance proportional to T3 at low temperature. Minimizing both the thermal conductance and the operating temperature is essential for achieving high sensitivity. Current micron-size Ti bolometer devices can clearly resolve mid-IR fauxtons with a device-limited sensitivity. Sufficient sensitivity to detect single THz photons can be achieved by scaling down the active device volume or by reducing Tc."

In the case of spectral line observations in the presence of atmospheric backgound, the integration time to reach a certain desired signal to noise level can be reduced by about a factor of two by rejecting the unused sideband. A proof-of-concept sideband separating mixer has been successfully designed and produced over the past few years, the results of which have been presented earlier at this conference. At the time that the band 9 cartridge got its final form, however, this mixer was not yet ready for series production. Here, we present a design study that investigates the feasibility of upgrading the current ALMA band 9 cartridge to full dual-polarisation sideband separating capability, with minimal impact on the overall structure of the cartridge. The goal is to re-use as many of the parts and techniques of the existing cartridge as possible to provide a minimal-cost upgrade path, to be available in a couple of years."

The ALMA receivers e.g. will be equipped with 2SB mixers for band 3 to 8. And Band 9 is also working on a sideband-separating version. Initially the specification for the image rejection of the ALMA receivers was set to -10 dB. But since all groups had difficulties in achieving these values for all produced mixers, the specification had to be relaxed. It still seems to be difficult to explain, why it is a problem to achieve good image rejections with 2SB mixers. Simply summing up gain and phase imbalances of the different components and calculating the image rejection almost always results in better values than finally achieved in real mixers. We will examine in detail the influence of each component of the 2SB mixer on the achieved image rejection for the case of our ALMA Band 7 mixer. The measured results will be compared to theoretically derived values."

Even with a measured receiver noise temperature down as low as five times the quantum limit (5hv/kB), this NbN SIS mixer doesn't demonstrate reasonably good direct-detection behavior as conventional Nb SIS mixers. It is thought that the enhanced shot-noise due to the MAR (multiple Andreev reflection) effect is considerably larger in direct detection than in heterodyne mixing. To better understand this difference, in this paper we mainly investigate the shot-noise characteristics of NbN superconducting tunnel junctions. Firstly, the power spectral density of the shot noise resulting from 0.5-THz NbN twin SIS junctions is measured with respect to the dc bias voltage by a low-frequency (~100 Hz) and high-frequency (a few GHz) method. The measured results are compared with simulated ones to understand how the shot noise is enhanced by the MAR effect. Secondly, the direct-detection and heterodyne mixing characteristics of the 0.5-THz NbN twin SIS junctions are measured and compared. Detailed experimental and simulation results will be presented."

The transition comprised a unilateral finline taper and the RF power from the finline slot is coupled through coplanar waveguide to microstrip using two radial stubs. This transition is significantly easier to design and fabricate than the conventional antipodal finline taper since the fins do not overlap at any stage. A key feature of this design is that it can be deposited on Silicon-on-Insulator resulting in a finline mixer chip on approximately 15 micron silicon substrate. This allows the mixer chip to be held in the E-plane of the waveguide without a supporting groove in the waveguide wall, avoiding the excitation of higher order modes. The chip is simply supported by gold leads deposited on the substrate. It should be emphasized that the employment of such substrate will also decrease the loss and allow finline mixers design to be extended to the THz region."

Consequently, under operating conditions the superconducting properties are no longer the equilibrium properties as realized by the fabrication conditions, but are deteriorated by the applied magnetic field. We report the measurements of I-V curves and Fourier transmission spectrum to determine and correlate the evolution of the superconducting properties in a high magnetic field.

Two types of waveguide HEB devices have been used: a 0.8 THz HEB mixer and a 1.0 THz HEB mixer which is ~5 times smaller than the former. Two independent experimental approaches were used. In the delta G/G method, the conversion gain of the HEB mixer is first measured as a function of the bias current for a number of bias voltages. At each bias setting, we carefully measure the change in the operating current when the input loads are switched. From the measured data, we can derive the expected difference in gain between the hot and cold loads. In the second method (injection method), the linearity of the HEB mixer is independently measured by injecting a modulated signal for different input load temperatures. The results of both approaches confirm that there is gain compression in the operation of HEB mixers. Based on the results of our measurements, we discuss the impact of direct detection effects on the operation of HEB mixers."

Kawamura","Karasik",NULL,"P7","288","0","2009","We will present the first data demonstrating multiplexed operation of the titanium (Ti) hot-electron nanobolometers at ~ 0.4 K. Nanobolometers are very promising for meeting the most demanding sensitivity requirements for THz spectroscopy in space. At the same time, they have a short time constant (~ microseconds at 400 mK) that makes impossible application of time-domain or audio-frequency domain multiplexing schemes commonly use for leg-isolated (slow) superconducting bolometers. A novel solution pursued in this work is called MSQUID and uses dc SQUIDs coupled to X-band microresonators. SQUIDs are very low-noise, low power dissipating superconducting devices commonly used for readout of superconducting bolometers. Their input bandwidth is limited by inductive coupling to the bolometer and does not exceed ~1 MHz that is suitable for one hot-electron detector pixel. At the same time, the SQUIDs themselves are very fast and can operate at many GHz. This gives a way to implement a multiplexed readout for nanobolometers by measuring a change of the Q-factor of an X-band coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator coupled to the SQUID. The detected radiation causes a change of the current through the bolometer and through the input coil of the SQUID. This causes a change of the magnetic flux through the SQUID loop, which changes the SQUID impedance and introduces damping in a coupled resonator. Each SQUID in the array is coupled to its individual resonator. The unique resonator frequency (resonator length) provides microwave frequency encoding for each pixel. The number of channels (pixels) per one MSQUID depends on the Q-factor of the resonators and can be about several 100s. At the same time, all MSQUIDS require just 2 pairs of wires for biasing and flux modulation and two microwave cables for passing the probe signal through the resonators. The output of many (~100) MSQUIDs can be also multiplexed thus leading to a possibility to read a 10,000-pixel array using this approach. The type of the multiplexor was inspired by the Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) and has the same advantages (large bandwidth, many pixels). We are setting up a demo-array consisting of 4 hot-electron nanobolometers with the noise equivalent power NEP ~ 10-17 W/Hz1/2 at 400 mK connected to a 4-element MSQUID chip. The entire system will operate in a He3 dewar with the optical access. We plan to demonstrate the complete recovery of the detector noise after demultiplexing and also the simultaneous detection of NIR single photons in all 4 channels. The latter is important since the nanobolometers are seen as potential THz calorimeters for on-chip FIR spectroscopy. The follow-up work will address larger scale fully integrated array of more sensitive nanobolometers hybridized with a matching MSQUID chip."

We are constructing a MKID-based camera for the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory with 576 spatial pixels each simultaneously sensitive in 4 bands at 750, 850, 1100, and 1300 microns. Each spatial pixel consists of an octave-bandwidth phased-array slot-dipole antenna to define the radiation pattern. The antenna output is coupled to four independent MKIDs via parallel photolithographic band-defining filters corresponding to the four bands. The full focal plane will consist of 16 tiles of 36 spatial pixels each. Each tile will use a single coplanar waveguide to couple the 144 quarter-wave microwave resonators to a single cryogenic amplifier. The novelty of MKIDs has required us to develop new techniques for detector characterization. To determine optical loading, measurements of lifetime were made by coupling energy into the resonators both optically and by driving the third harmonic of the resonator. The two techniques yield equivalent lifetime measurements with values in the few microsecond range under optical loading. Optical loading has also been determined using internal Q measurements, which range between 15,000 and 30,000 for our resonators. Quasiparticle lifetime and resonator Qs have been measured for detector bath temperatures between 200 mK and 400 mK.

The receiver employs sensitive SIS mixers, working over 85-116GHz frequency range. Sideband separation (2SB) scheme is adopted to enable high-precision calibration procedure and to reduce the idle sideband noise especially when the atmosphere transparency is not good in some seasons. The SIS mixers were designed to have nearly constant dynamic resistance and uniform conversion gain, allowing stable bias and direct connection of the SIS mixer and the cryogenic low noise amplifier without an IF isolator. Besides, low noise and stable digital SIS bias circuit has been designed to operate the SIS mixer efficiently. The nine 2SB mixers are driven by a single LO signal source. Two stages of cascaded power dividers realized by 6-branch line directional couplers distribute the LO signal with good isolation between paths. The LO is generated by a frequency synthesizer followed by an amplifier-multiplier module providing output put power not less than 10mW across the RF band. The IF band is centered at 2.64GHz and bandwidth 1GHz allowing simultaneously observing three CO lines (C18O, 13CO and 12CO), which has been proved to be an efficient observation mode in probing a broad range of gas density. The nine pixels yield 18 independent IF outputs. Each of them is processed by a digital FFT spectrometer with 200MHz-1GHz reconfigurable bandwidth and 16384 channels, which has obvious merits over the present analog AOS system to form a compact and reliable backend system for focal array receiver. The whole multi-beam receiver system will be demonstrated in lab by the end of 2009."

It is a first generation, PI class instrument, designed for detailed, high sensitivity observations of warm (100 K) interstellar gas, both in galactic sources and in external galaxies. CASIMIR will have unprecedented sensitivity by combining the 2.5-meter SOFIA mirror with state-of-the-art superconducting mixers. These planar mixers are quasi-optically coupled to the telescope beam using twin-slot antennas, and silicon hyperhemisphere lenses with Parylene antireflection coatings. Ongoing mixer developments point to DSB noise temperature improvements of 3 hv/k at frequencies below 1 THz, and 6 hv/k above 1 THz. All CASIMIR bands use advanced Superconductor-Insulator- Superconductor (SIS) mixers fabricated with Nb/AlN/NbTiN junctions in the JPL Micro Devices Lab. Five bands are under development: 550 GHz, 750 GHz, 1000 GHz, 1250 GHz, and 1400 GHz. Observing time is maximized by having four bands available on each flight. Tunerless solid-state local oscillators are mounted on the outside of the cryostats, with injection to the mixers via mirrors and cryogenically-cooled mylar beamsplitters. The optics box supporting the two cryostats is open to the telescope cavity and contains the relay optics and calibration systems. Besides the cryostat pressure and IR-block windows, all optics are reflective and can accommodate the entire 8' telescope field of view. Bias electronics and warm IF amplifiers are mounted on the cryostats, while electronics racks contain the backend spectrometer, control electronics, and power supplies. The entire instrument is about 1.5 m long, 1 m diameter, and weighs about 550 kg. CASIMIR embodies a versatile and modular design, able to incorporate future major advances in detector, LO and spectrometer technology. CASIMIR will enable the study of fundamental rotational transitions of many significant hydrides and other molecules, which can provide critical tests of our understanding of interstellar chemical networks and reactions. CASIMIR will aid in understanding the chemistry of oxygen in interstellar clouds, with observations of key species, such as O, O2, H2O, H2O+, and OH. The H2D+ ion is of particular interest, as it is the deuterated version of H3+, which is believed to be responsible for driving much of the chemistry of molecular clouds. CASIMIR will allow the study of the abundance and distribution of interstellar water, which plays an important role in the energy balance of molecular clouds; nine rotational transitions of the rare H218O istopomer can be detected, including several lines near the ground state."

Also, a measurement method is introduced where the hot/cold response of the receiver is recorded at constant voltage bias of the mixer, while varying the LO power. We argue that this method provides an accurate measurement of the receiver noise temperature, which is not influenced by the LO power fluctuations and the direct detection effect.

We measured a double sideband receiver noise temperature of 2100 K at the optimum local oscillator power of 290 nW.

MKIDs are superconducting resonators with resonant frequency and quality-factor which are highly sensitive to changes in the density of the quasiparticle population which occurs when photons above the superconducting gap energy are absorbed. The resonators are coupled to submm light through on-chip phased-array slot antennas. Each planar antenna consists of an array of N long slots which are fed along their length at M points. The resulting N*M feed points are combined in-phase using a binary summing tree made of low-loss superconducting microstrip lines. Due to its large size, the resulting planar antenna produces a narrow beam pattern and can therefore be used without additional optical coupling elements such as feedhorns or substrate lenses. The output of the antenna is a single superconducting thin-film microstrip line which can be efficiently coupled to one (or more) kinetic inductance coplanar waveguide resonators to produce a single (or multi-color) pixel in an imaging focal plane array, using in-line lumped element lithographic band-pass filters. Such highly integrated architectures can be easily fabricated on a single substrate, and many detectors can be frequency multiplexed through coupling to a single feedline. Microwave readout provides a lot of bandwidth per detector, allowing a large number of pixels to be read using a single cryogenic microwave amplifier and warm readout electronics.

M. Klapwijk","Barends",NULL,"5","142","0","2008","The low temperature microwave properties of superconducting resonators for kinetic inductance photon detectors and quantum computation are attracting increased attention. At low temperatures both a significant excess frequency noise and deviations in the resonance frequency from Mattis-Bardeen theory have been found. It has been suggested that these anomalies are caused by dipole two-level systems residing in dielectric layers near surfaces, which interact with the high frequency electric fields in the resonator. In order to identify to what extent two-level systems in dielectrics affect the microwave properties of superconducting films we study NbTiN resonators with a 10, 40 or 160 nm thick SiO2 covering layer. We find that the resonance frequency of bare NbTiN resonators, unlike Nb, Ta and Al resonators, closely follows Mattis-Bardeen theory down to 350 mK. We demonstrate that deviations in the resonance frequency can be generated by covering the resonators with a thin amorphous SiO2 layer, and that these deviations scale with the layer thickness. In addition, we find that the frequency noise is strongly increased as soon as a SiO2 layer is present, but is, counter-intuitively, independent of the layer thickness. These observations show that the physical mechanisms causing the excess frequency noise are different from those responsible for the deviations in the resonance frequency."

Seppä","Helistö","Helistoe, Helisto, Seppae, Seppa","5","153","0","2008","For large scale multiplexing of high-resolution astrophysical radiation detectors, power gain is needed. The power gain is normally provided by the readout amplifier, but especially in the case of time division multiplexing, power gain by the detector is beneficial. In this paper, we characterise the achievable power gain, dynamic range, noise and stability of resistively biased transition detectors. Superconducting transition detectors such as X-ray calorimeters or THz bolometers are usually operated in voltage biased mode at voltages much below the minimum of the detector I - V curve. Such biasing provides high current responsivity, low Johnson noise, high stability and good linearity due to the strong negative electrothermal feedback (ETF). However, there is no power gain in the detector. This calls for a very low noise readout amplifier, typically SQUID, in the case of cryomultiplexing. Recently, it was shown that by voltage biasing the detector at the I - V curve minimum, a room temperature amplifier can read out the signal of transition detectors operated even in the mK range. This is due to the effective power gain in the detector near the minimum current bias point: the output noise power rdin2 of the detector diverges as the differential resistance of the detector rd [] []. Unfortunately, at high frequencies, rd is reduced, making the method not optimal for high bandwidth cryomultiplexing. Here we demonstrate that by biasing the detector through a bias resistor, power gain G is obtained, the maximum of which is equal to the ETF loop gain L0. The available power gain is limited by stability: the dynamic resistance of the system has to be positive at all frequencies. In first experiments we have measured power gains of up to 10-20. In an optimized system, we expect to achieve maximum power gain up to 50-100, allowing multiplexing of up to 100 detectors in the scheme described in Ref 4. "

Our group is now constructing SuperCam, a 64 pixel heterodyne array for operation in the 350 GHz atmospheric window. This instrument will realize another order of magnitude increase in array pixel count. Several new techniques were used for SuperCam to maximize integration and modularity. Unlike other SIS array receivers, SuperCam is built around 8 pixel linear mixer modules, rather than independent mixer blocks. These modules house 8 single ended waveguide mixers with SOI substrate SIS devices. Each device is tab bonded to a MMIC based LNA. These modules dissipate only 8 mW of heat, while still maintaining 5 K IF noise temperature and 32 dB gain. Blind mate IF and DC connectors allow each module to be inserted in or removed from the focal plane as a unit. The modules are machined using a state-of-the-art CNC micromilling machine acquired specifically for this project. IF signals are processed by 8 channel IF downconverter boards, which provide gain, baseband downconversion and IF total power monitoring. A real-time FFT spectrometer implemented with high speed ADCs and Xilinx 4 FPGAs produce spectra of the central 250 MHz of each channel at 0.25 km/s spectral resolution. For arrays with an additional order of magnitude increase in pixel count, several additional technical problems must be overcome. Kilopixel arrays will require advances in device fabrication, cryogenics, micromachining, IF processing and spectrometers. In addition, seemingly straightforward receiver systems will require new approaches to realize a kilopixel heterodyne array with manageable complexity and cost. Wire count and 4K heat load must all be reduced significantly compared to SuperCam. IF and DC cabling and interconnects may be replaced with multiconductor microstrip or stripline ribbon. Parallel biasing of LNAs, magnets and even SIS devices is feasible if device uniformity is good enough. IF processing will require further integration, possibly with integrated MMIC chips containing all parts of a IF downconversion chain. Continued advances in FFT spectrometers could allow processing many hundreds of gigahertz of IF bandwidth for a realizable cost. We present results from final SuperCam receiver integration and testing, and concepts for expanding heterodyne arrays to kilopixel scales in the future."

This power level combined with very good intrinsic frequency definition characteristics make QCLs an extremely appealing solid-state solution as compact sources for THz transmission and illumination and for local oscillators in THz heterodyne receiver systems. However, several challenges to the implementation of QCLs as practical THz sources remain. Among these challenges are to shape the highly divergent and non-Gaussian output beam patterns observed from QCLs into a more useful and predictable beam shape, and to integrate QCLs into the existing, broadly used THz technical infrastructure. One attractive approach to solving both the beam shaping problem and the integration issue is to integrate QCLs into appropriate rectangular waveguides. If the output from a QCL can be efficiently coupled into single-mode rectangular waveguide, then the radiation mode structure will be known, and the propagation, manipulation, and broadcast of the QCL radiation can then be entirely controlled by well-established rectangular waveguide techniques. Because typical QCL frequencies are > 2 THz, the dimensions of single-mode rectangular waveguide at these wavelengths are on the order of tens of microns. While such small THz waveguides can be made by traditional metal machining, this method is typically expensive, slow, and difficult to reconcile with the electrical connections needed to support high DC bias currents (order 1 A) required to operate a QCL embedded in such waveguide. We will report on our efforts to use semiconductor lithographic methods to micromachine small, single-mode rectangular waveguide structures compatible with integration of QCLs into a waveguide circuit. Such a micromachining approach has the advantage of being amenable to largescale production and can be tailored to suit the unique demands of a QCL source."

Band 9, covering 602-720 GHz, is the highest frequency band in the baseline ALMA project, and will thus offer the telescope's highest spatial resolutions. This paper describes the design of the Band 9 receiver cartridges for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). These are field-replaceable heterodyne front-ends offering high sensitivity, 602-720 GHz frequency coverage, 4-12 GHz IF bandwidth, and high quasioptical efficiencies. Because the project will ultimately require up to 64 cartridges to fully populate the ALMA array, two key aspects of the design of the Band 9 cartridge have been to take advantage of commercial manufacturing capabilities and to simplify the assembly of the cartridge."

Thomas, Stafford Withington, and George Saklatvala","Thomas",NULL,"11","329","338","2008","Any bolometer that is greater than a few wavelengths in size is receptive to the power in a number of fully coherent optical modes simultaneously. Knowing the amplitude, phase, and polarisation patterns of these modes, and their relative sensitivities, is central to being able to use a multimode detector effectively. We describe a procedure for measuring the spatial state of coherence to which a detector is sensitive. Diagonalisation of the coherence function then gives the natural modes. The scheme is based on the result that the expectation value of the output of any detector, or indeed whole instrument or telescope, is given by the contraction of two tensor fields: one of which describes the state of coherence of the incoming radiation, and the other describes the state of coherence to which the detector is sensitive. It follows that if a detector is illuminated by two coherent point sources, in the near or far field, and the phase of one source rotated relative to the other, the output of the detector displays a fringe. By repeating the process with different source locations, the detector's coherence tensor can be reconstructed from the recorded complex visibilities. This new, powerful technique is essentially aperture synthesis interferometry in reverse, and therefore many of the data processing techniques developed in the context of astronomy can be used for characterising the optical behaviour of few-mode bolometers."

We present results on the development of NbN ultra-thin film technology and the systematic study of superconducting and transport properties of NbN bridge-structures with different thickness (4 - 10 nm) and width (0.1 - 10 micron). The NbN films are deposited onto heated Si substrate by magnetron sputtering of Nb target in the reactive gas mixture of argon and nitrogen. A critical temperature of about 9.5 K is reached for NbN films with a thickness between 5 and 6 nm. Twofold increase of the film thickness increases the critical temperature to 12 K. Reducing the bridge width below 0.5 micron leads to a decrease in its critical temperature that is similar to the effect of the film thickness. The model of intrinsic proximity effect in ultra-thin films explains fairly well the degradation of superconductivity in NbN bridges with the decrease of either film thickness or bridge width. Moreover, the proximity effect theory agrees well with experimental data on the critical temperature variations in NbN/Au bi-layers with different thickness of the Au layer. We have shown that an 18 nm thick buffer layer of NbN under much thicker Au layer is sufficient to ensure a bi-layer critical temperature of 8.5 K that is close to the critical temperature of 5 nm thick HEB devices.

The e-beam patterned HSQ is used as a mask in reactive ion etching for HEB definition and then remains on top of the HEB providing protection against contamination. This process is relatively simple since it requires less steps than previously reported and therefore reduces the risk of degradation of the ultra thin NbN film. To get good quality membranes for THz-HEB applications, different membrane process have been investigated.

Comparable mixers will also be used in the balloon-borne Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory (STO). In the current baseline approach for these receivers, the mixer is connected to the low noise IF amplifier by a narrow-band (1.2-1.8 GHz) cryogenic isolator to prevent interactions between the 1-2 GHz amplifier and the mixer. Previous tests have indicated that an isolator is necessary for a stable receiver performance with minimal variations of noise and gain vs. IF frequency. Unfortunately, the isolator has the disadvantage that a significant fraction of the potential IF bandwidth of the mixer and low noise IF amplifier is wasted. Several approaches are currently being pursued for wide-bandwidth integration of mixers and IF amplifiers and experimental results will be reported at the conference. A first approach is a connection of a Caltech 0.5-11 GHz indium-phosphide LNA directly to the mixer without an isolator; initial results have shown large frequency ripple in the measured receiver noise temperature. The amplifier has excellent noise and flat gain when driven from a 50 ohm generator but does not present a 50 ohm load to the HEB mixer at IF frequencies below 4 GHz. The use of a small attenuator between LNA and mixer will be investigated. Finally, a new silicon-germanium (SiGe) LNA for the 0.3 to 5 GHz range with good input match is under test at Caltech and further tests of integration with the HEB mixer are planned prior to the conference."

ALMA frontends will be using Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) heterodyne mixers as the key sensitive elements for all of its high frequency bands. The ALMA band 9 receiver which covers 600-720 GHz is being developed in the Netherlands. The first eight receivers have already been built based on AlOx barrier SIS junctions mixers. These mixers have excellent noise temperature but show limited RF and IF bandwidth. Using new AlN barrier higher current density SIS junctions, it is possible to improve on the RF and IF bandwidth of SIS mixers thus making this technology significantly more attractive for the use in large series of SIS receivers. Currently, a good sensitivity and band coverage has already been achieved for AlN mixers. However, performance of AlN mixers at higher frequencies depends highly on Josephson noise suppression and is only optimal if a precise magnetic field is applied on the barrier. Present routines for Josephson noise suppression in AlOx barrier mixers were not sufficient. In this paper these routines will be discussed in detail and its adaptation to AlN barrier mixer operation will be reported."

A major limiting factor of higher current density junctions is the increase in subgap leakage that occurs in AlOX barriers as current densities approach and exceed 10kA/cm2. AlN insulators are a promising alternative due to their lower leakage current at these high current densities. In this paper we present a more detailed analysis of the formation of AlN barriers using our previously reported inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source growth technique. The ICP allows for independent control of ion energy and current density in the plasma. Additionally, plasmas with very low ion energy (~20eV) and a high degree of dissociation (~80%) can be achieved. This improved control allows for the repeatable formation of high quality barriers. In particular, we report on the relationship between barrier thickness and plasma conditions as determined by in-situ discrete ellipsometry. Ellipsometry results were verified by fabricating Nb/Al-AlN/Nb junctions and measuring current-voltage, I(V), curves. dc I(V) curves for a range of current densities are presented."

This work is based on extensive previous work on a 16 pixel 2-color demonstration camera tested at the CSO (see poster by A. Vayonakis et al.). Our camera focal plane will make use of three novel technologies: Microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKID), photolithographic phased array antennae, and on-chip band-pass filters. An MKID is a highly multiplexable photon detector that uses the change in surface impedance of a superconducting quarter-wave coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonator to detect light. The resonator is weakly coupled to a CPW feed line. The amplitude and phase of a microwave probe signal (at the resonance frequency) transmitted on the feed line past the resonator changes as photons break cooper pairs. Hundreds to thousands of resonators tuned to slightly different frequencies may be coupled to a single feed line resulting in an elegant multiplexing scheme to read out a large array. Our phased array antenna design obviates beam-defining feed horns. Onchip band-pass filters eliminate band-defining metal-mesh filters. Together, the antennae and filters enable each spatial pixel to observe in all four bands simultaneously. Due to the large number of pixels the step and repeat capability of our photolithography system will be used to reduce the number of required masks and the field size in the fabrication process. In order to reduce frequency noise due to fluctuations in the dielectric constant of the substrate, we are exploring new resonator designs that use interdigitated capacitors to lower electric field concentrations around the resonator lines. Readout will be done with software-defined radio and will use microwave IQ modulation which has been demonstrated at the CSO. We are working on the implementation of an improved design using sixteen X5-400M commercial FPGA boards operating at room temperature."

They are designed for an operation frequency at about 2.5 THz. One of the lasers has a Fabry-Perot resonator while the other laser is a distributed feedback (DFB) laser. The active medium of both lasers is based on a GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice. The design follows the so-called bound-to-continuum approach with a rather uniformly chirped superlattice and no marked distinction between the injection and lasing regions. Detailed high-resolution spectra of the laser emission as a function of temperature and current have been obtained by self-beating of the laser modes (only laser with Fabry-Perot resonator) as well as by mixing with the emission of a THz gas laser. We report on some spectral features, such as nonlinear dependences of the laser emission frequency on the current and singularities due to mode switching. The analysis shows frequency- and current-dependent nonlinearities of the frequency tuning for both lasers. The multi-mode QCL shows larger variations of the output power of a particular mode as well as larger frequency instabilities at the current values related to the mode switching. Less-expressed power variations have been found for the single mode DFB QCL. The results of the homodyne mixing indicate large variations of the effective refractive index in the active medium caused by the drive current. The implications for the use of the QCL as local oscillator in a heterodyne receiver will be discussed."

Meissner","Sydlo",NULL,"P8","520","0","2008","The work in the field of THz technology includes the emitters as well as the detectors. While a large number of approaches for THz emitters with increased power levels are evolving the detectors have show less progress in the last years. But essential for all THz work is the signal to noise ratio which also benefits from improved detectors. Nowadays, pyroelectric detectors and Golay cells are the most common room-temperature THz detectors available. They feature NEPs (noise-equivalent powers) down to 100 pW/Hz1/2, but their response time is quite large limiting the modulation to few tens Hertz. These detectors are quite bulky which inhibits flexible use. ACST has recently established a Schottky process for zero-bias detector diodes aiming at frequencies up to one THz and possibly higher. A specialised process allows forming of Schottky contacts with a very low barrier. This in turn provides low video resistances without the need for biasing. Due to the absence of bias, the noise of the detectors reduces to the Johnson limit of the video resistance and is free of 1/f noise. The presented devices exhibit a video resistance less than 10 k Omega at zero-bias and voltage noise of less than 15 nV/Hz1/2 (measurements in full paper). Also the devices responsitivity shows values of more than 15 A/W or 2500 V/W. This results in a NEP of less than 6 pW/Hz1/2 combined with arbitrarily high modulation frequencies. The size of this detector with appendant amplifier is smaller than a matchbox (picture in full paper) allowing it to be placed and moved freely in any THz setup. However, it should be mentioned here, that this detector cannot compete yet with pyroelectric detectors or Golay cells at frequencies far beyond 1 THz."

Efforts devoted to grow NbN aim at improving their critical temperature and critical current density, while keeping their thickness in the 3 to 5 nm range and Tc above 10 K, which insure a large bandwidth and large SNR detection at 4K. Choice of substrate is critical: for applications, MgO wafers and R-plane sapphire are usually considered as best choice. However, growing NbN on either M-plane or A-plane orientations of sapphire wafers, 3 inch in diameter, can help improving the film quality and fabrication yield. NbN thin films were grown by reactive DC magnetron sputtering at about 600 degrees C and passivated by an AlN layer 1.5 nm thick deposited in-situ at room temperature. Growth on M-plane is shown to be better than on other sapphire orientations, including R-plane. NbN layer critical temperature reaches 13.3 K. Their properties are uniform on the 3 inch wafer, for a film thickness of 4.4 nm measured by X-ray reflectivity.

When the ZnSe nano-dots covered 10% of total radiation surface, the radiation power is about two times stronger than that from the bulk bare sample (Fig. 2).

This paper presents a quasi-optical six-port reflectometer designed for 585 GHz using hot-electron bolometers (HEB's). In this design, a ring slot antenna couples a signal into the reflectometer creating a standing wave along a microstrip transmission line. The standing wave is sampled by three evenly spaced HEB's. A polarization rotation resulting from the feed of the transmission line allows the antenna to act as both the input and measurement ports (horizontally polarized energy is coupled into the device and re-radiated with vertical polarization). The reflectometer is expected to be sensitive to nanowatt power levels from 570 GHz to 640 GHz. The annular slot antenna and microstrip portion of the device have been independently fabricated and tested. This proof-of-concept test verifies that the polarization is rotated and provides an estimate of the power available for sampling. It was found that approximately 30 microW of power is available, as measured with an Erickson power meter. Simulations in conjunction with these data indicate that the HEB's should be capable of detecting 100's of nanowatts. This requires each HEB to have approximate dimensions of 100nm by 200nm.

The high precision, time-domain spectroscopy is unique method of analysis of multicomponent gas mixtures. This method has the sensitivity at level of 0,2 ppb, has high selectivity and possibility of measuring the  investigated substances concentration. Besides, this method is simple to using. Nowadays there exist two approaches for THz pulse generation for tabletop devices.

The spectrometer of 1-2.5 THz frequency range (with registration of a signal in time area) based on solid-state radiation sources is considered in this report. The necessity of development the new THz sources is concerned with the fact, that the present emission sources (such as back-wave oscillator (BWO)) are extremely expensive and have large sizes and quite short time of exploitation.

Finline SIS mixers have shown good performance in the 230 and 350 GHz bands, and we have also previously reported results from two finline SIS mixers in the 600-720 GHz band, obtaining best receiver noise temperatures of ~250 K. In this paper we present results from several finline mixers in the 600-720 GHz band, using both variants of our original 3-stage Chebyshev filter tuned single junction mixers and new Belitsky tuned mixers. These dual junction tuned mixers show significantly better performance than our previously reported results, with receiver noise temperatures below 200 K. We present detailed SuperMix simulations of the receiver performance and compare these with measured results. We find good agreement between simulations and measured performance can be achieved by introducing a small amount of attenuation in the RF circuit of the mixer. We also present simulations of the IF bandwidth of finline mixers, and suggest a method by which this can be greatly improved."

However, for the preliminary RF tests presented in this paper, the 780-950 GHz tripler was pumped by a chain of two cascaded fixed-tuned balanced doublers able to deliver 4-10.5 mW in the band 273-320 GHz when pumped by a 120-150 mW solid-state source. Due to the limited bandwidth of the driver chain, only tests at frequencies above 820 GHz have been performed. A dual-chip version of the wideband six-anode 260-340GHz frequency tripler presented in is currently in the process of being fabricated and should replace soon the current driver. Room temperature measurements show a conversion efficiency above 1% across the 820-950 GHz band with a peak conversion efficiency of 3.6% at 820 GHz. The output power is above 100 microW from 820 GHz to 935 GHz and falls to 40microW at 950 GHz with a maximum of 325 microW of output power at 852 GHz. Predictions are in close agreement with these measurements, thus, the multiplier is expected to cover frequencies below 820 GHz (which is actually the peak efficiency) down to 870 GHz once a broader-band driver is assembled. During the measurements all the bias voltage of all three multipliers were kept constant therefore the local oscillator chain was very easy to operate (it was fix-tuned and fix-biased)."

They have been successfully demonstrated as LO in laboratory's tests using a hot/cold load. Until now only QCLs based on Fabry-Perot cavity have been investigated as LO, including their beam patterns. However, to perform a spectroscopic measurement, QCLs with a stable single-mode emission at a precisely designed wavelength are desirable. For this purpose, a distributed feedback (DFB) structure, which is based on the first order Bragg gratings incorporated into the waveguide, needs to be introduced into QCLs. Here we report the first beam pattern measurements of 3.4 THz DFB surface plasmon QCLs. The beam patterns are known to be crucial for coupling the radiation to a mixer. The QCLs used are developed by University of Neuchatel. The active region is based on a bound-to-continuum design, while the DFB structure is based on strongly coupled surface grating fabricated with wet etching and metal coverage. Two QCLs with ridge widths of 100 micron or 200 micron have been studied and both lase in single-mode at 3.4 THz. To measure the far-field beam patterns, we use a similar setup as for the metal-metal waveguide QCLs3, but with a reduced surface area of the pyroelectric detector to improve the angular resolution. We found that the beams follow nearly the diffraction limit, if measured with a poor angular resolution and a coarse scanning. However, we observed the interference patterns, characterized by a strong modulation in the intensity with a (intensity) minimum in the pointing direction of the laser, if measured with a relatively high angular resolution and a fine scanning. We also notice that the interference patterns behave in a very much different way as in metal-metal waveguide QCLs3,4, suggesting a different physical origin. Such beam patterns make heterodyne mixing using the DFB QCLs and an NbN HEB mixer extremely challenging."

Using the shadow mask evaporation technique we fabricated nanoscale Ti bridges with Nb Andreev contacts. The devices were fabricated on a Si wafer and did not rely on the thermal insulation due to the membrane support normally required in conventional bolometers. The thermal conductance in our devices is set by the electron-phonon coupling, which is very weak in disordered metals at subKelvin temperatures. From the electrical measurements, the thermal conductance was found to be ~ 2 fW/K at 300 mK and ~ 0.1 fW/K at 40 mK. If the thermal fluctuation noise is dominant in the devices then such a uniquely low thermal conductance should provide the NEP required for most demanding applications. The measurements involving detection of single NIR photons (Lambda = 1550 nm) allowed for determination of the bolometer thermal time constant (electron-phonon relaxation time) being of 20 microseconds at 200 mK and a few microseconds at 370 mK. The latter measurements were hindered by the limited SQUID bandwidth (100 kHz). A broadband 1 MHz SQUID is being set up for future experiments on single photon detection. The output electrical noise measured in the devices in the voltage-bias mode was dominated by the thermal energy fluctuations (phonon noise). This was an indication that the responsivity was sufficiently high (i.e., the superconducting transition was steep enough). The very low NEP and the high speed are a unique combination not found in other detectors. This would allow for a very high data rate in an application, though more work is needed to develop an adequate read-out/multiplexing electronics for this type of detector. Beside the extremely low phonon-noise NEP, the nanobolometers have a very low electron heat capacitance. This makes them promising as detectors of single FIR photons for the moderate resolution spectroscopy above 1 THz where the background photon arrival rate is less than the detector speed."

Crowe","Hesler",NULL,"4","89","92","2007","Schottky barrier diodes can be used as direct detectors throughout the millimeter- and submillimeterwave bands. When the diodes are optimized to have a low forward turn-on voltage, the detectors can achieve excellent frequency response and bandwidth, even with zero-bias. This paper reports on the characterization of VDI's zerobias Schottky detectors. Responsivity typically ranges from 4,000 V/W at 100 GHz to 400 V/W at 900 GHz and each detector achieves good responsivity across the entire singlemoded bandwidth of the input rectangular waveguide. Under low power operation the detectors achieve a measured noise-equivalent-power (NEP) of about 1.5x10-12 W/square rootHz, even without signal modulation. Such high sensitivity is expected for any zero-bias diode detector with high responsivity when there is no incident RF power; since only thermal noise can be generated under this condition. However, as the input power is increased, excess noise is generated. This noise typically has a 1/f power spectrum and is commonly known as flicker noise. Flicker noise becomes increasingly important as the input power is increased and signal modulation is generally required to achieve maximum sensitivity. The signal-to-noise of the VDI zero-bias detectors has been carefully measured as a function of input power and modulation rate. This data allows the user to understand the sensitivity of the detector under real operating conditions, and is therefore far more useful than the simple measurement of detector NEP with zero RF power, which is commonly quoted in the literature for new diode detector designs."

The detectors will operate at temperatures of approximately 100 mK and will be read out by time division or frequency multiplexed SQUID amplifiers. Although detectors are expected to deliver impressive sensitivity, future space B-mode experiments (eg B-Pol) can benefit greatly from an increase in sensitivity, much higher saturation power, and flexibility in their realization on planar substrates. In this paper we describe a Cold-Electron Bolometer (CEB), which is a serious candidate for the next space cosmology missions. We analyze the suitability of various devices for the 70 GHz channel of the proposed B-Pol polarimeter. The detector may also be of interest to ground-based experiment as a result of the simplicity of its integration to planar circuit technology. The Capacitively Coupled CEB is a planar antenna-coupled superconducting detector with high sensitivity and high dynamic range. The CEB can meet noise requirements with both SQUID and JFET readouts. The SQUID readout can be used the same as for TES bolometers with typical SQUID sensitivity of 0.5 pA/Hz1/2. An attractive realisation of the detector at millimetre wavelengths is to fabricate the CEB directly connected to the antenna on a planar substrate. The proper matching can be achieved by fabrication of an absorber strip of resistance equal to the wave impedance of the antenna. Three variants of the CEB concept have been considered. The optimum realization of a CEB with SIN and SN tunnel junctions gives noise less than photon noise with SQUID readout. Estimations of the CEB noise with a JFET readout (at 300 K and 4.2 K) has shown an opportunity to realize background-limited performance for realistic power loading. Matching to a JFET is best obtained by using the SCEB (with weak superconducting absorber), and choosing a voltage bias in the flat region of the IV curve with very high dynamic resistance. This configuration can gives photon noise limited performance with JFET readout over a wide range of optical loading levels. Another possibility for matching to a JFET is a current-biased series array of CEBs with normal metal absorbers, connected in parallel for HF signal. The antenna-coupled CEB bolometer is easy to couple to a wide range of planar antennae systems, either on bulk or membrane substrates. Applicability of the CEB to B-Pol and similar space missions looks very promising for all of the frequency bands and with both JFET and SQUID readout schemes."

The proposed structure consists of a dielectric waveguide made of high dielectric constant and low loss materials, such as Alumina, high-resistive silicon, and GaAs, located above a dielectric support substrate, such as Teflon and Plexiglas. The power is coupled into and out of the waveguide by means of two metallic rectangular waveguides without any horn type extensions, which makes the metallic waveguide structure easy to fabricate and low-cost.

The taper length is optimized to have maximum coupling efficiency. The dielectric waveguide is designed to be single mode at the given frequency range in order to minimize the dispersion and to have maximum overlap between the field distribution inside the rectangular waveguide and that of the dielectric waveguide.

When observing at THz frequencies these problems become more and more prominent due to the increased required bandwidth. Mostly, such patterns are attributed to reflections in the telescope optics, particularly from the sub-reflector in a Cassegrain telescope. But there are many other sources of standing waves in the quasi-optics of a heterodyne receiver. In this paper we describe the effect of reflections between mixer and local oscillator (LO) inside of a receiver. Some portion of the signal radiation becomes reflected by the mixer, and propagates partly to the LO with reduced amplitude due to the generally small reflectivity of the beam combiner. Nevertheless, although the power in one roundtrip becomes significantly reduced, there is still enough amplitude left, so that interference with the incoming signal radiation becomes visible."

In this paper we present the spectral measurements and simulated results of absorption properties at 4.2 K for a resonant mesa geometry. The thermal conductance and time constant of 2D electrons are studied at 450 mK-4.2 K. We measure an electron-phonon conductance on the order of 10-17 W/K per electron at 450 mK which gives a low value of heat conductance 2DEG relative to normal metal absorbers due to the low 2DEG electron density. These devices have a combination of sensitivity and speed which makes them possible candidates for the components in future astrophysical THz instruments."

The probe provides the connection between an Oleson Microwave Labs Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) mm-wave extender head and on-wafer ground-signalground contacts. The probe has a section of WR-3 waveguide with a standard flange, a waveguide-to-coax transition with provisions for adjustment of both the E-field launch and back short. From the waveguide-to-coax transition, a short length of UT-013 coax connects to a thin-film membrane that includes a coax-to-microstrip transition and three wafer contacts manufactured photolithograpically using Cascade Microtech's thin-film process. The wafer contacts use the same mechanical structure and metallurgy as Cascade's Pyramid probe series, and are rated for millions of touchdowns with contact resistance of a few tens of milliohms even on aluminum pads. Initial measurements on a pair of WR-3 probes and a standard calibration substrate with Cascade's 140 to 220 GHz VNA system suggest that loss is dominated by the length of waveguide between the coax-to-waveguide transition and the Oleson Microwave Lab mmwave extender head. Measurements on the WR-5 band VNA are limited to the lower third of the WR-3 band. A second set of probes was built using significantly shorter waveguide sections. The original probes and short waveguide probes were then measured on the Jet Propulsion Labs WR-3 VNA system. Loss through the longer probes was more than 5 dB from waveguide flange to probe tip, and loss through the short waveguide probes was near 2.5 dB for most of the WR-3 band, with increased loss above 300 GHz. Increased loss above 300 GHz is apparently due to poor contact with the back short during the measurements for the probe we tested. Since the waveguide probes have electrically floating center contacts on the Ground-Signal-Ground membrane, we have also developed integrated bias Ts. To date, in-band performance of the bias Ts has only been measured on the WR-5 VNA, and the out-of-band performance measured using a DC to 110 GHz VNA."

Here, we present sideband ratio measurements of a submillimeter receiver in the 600-720 GHz band (ALMA Band 9) using a Michelson interferometer as input filter. The main requirement for this method is that the resolution must be high enough to allow distinguishing between the two side bands of the DSB receiver. The advantages of this method are, first, the simplicity of the experimental setup, and, second, the possibility to identify and calibrate out standing waves in the signal and local oscillator paths. In our procedure we use, in fact, exactly the same receiver configuration for both direct and heterodyne detections.

Traditionally KIDs have been constructed from superconducting quarter-wavelength or half-wavelength resonator elements capacitivly coupled to a co-planar feed line. Photons are detected by measuring the change in quasi-particle density caused by the splitting of Cooper pairs in the superconducting resonant element. This change in quasi-particle density alters the kinetic inductance, and hence the resonant frequency of the resonant element. This arrangement requires the quasi-particles generated by photon absorption to be concentrated at positions of high current density in the resonator. This is usually achieved through antenna coupling or quasi-particle trapping. For these detectors to work at wavelengths shorter than around 500 micron where antenna coupling can introduce a significant loss of efficiency, then a direct absorption method needs to be considered. One solution to this problem is the Lumped Element KID (LEKID), which shows no current variation along its length and can be arranged into a photon absorbing area coupled to free space and therefore requiring no antennas or quasi-particle trapping. This paper outlines the relevant microwave theory of a LEKID, along with theoretical performance for these devices."

Radiation coupling efficiency and directive properties of integrated lens antennas with log-spiral, log-periodic and double-slot planar feeds coupled to a hot-electron bolometer were experimentally studied at frequencies from 1 THz to 6 THz and compared with simulations based on the method of moments and the physical-optics ray tracing. For all studied antennas the modeled spectral dependence of the coupling efficiency fits to the experimental data obtained with both Fourier transform spectroscopy and noise temperature measurements only if the complex impedance of the bolometer is explicitly taken into account. Our experimental data did not indicate any noticeable contribution of the quantum noise to the system noise temperature. The experimentally observed deviation of the beam pattern from the model prediction increases with frequency and is most likely due to a non-ideality of the presently used lenses. Study of the intermediate frequency mixer gain at local oscillator (LO) frequencies between 2.5 THz and 0.3 THz showed an increase of the gain bandwidth at low LO frequencies that was understood as the contribution of the direct interaction of magnetic vortices with the radiation field. We have found that the non-homogeneous hot-spot model more adequately describes variation of the intermediate frequency bandwidth with the applied local oscillator power than any of uniform mixer models.

No grooves are machined into the horn walls but, alternatively, flare angle discontinuities are generated along the horn profile. In other words, the horns will have several flare angles or sections instead of one. For example, if the horn consists of two flare angles, it could then be considered as a conventional Potter horn. As can be seen below, even with this simple design, excellent radiation patterns can be obtained over 15% bandwidth. The bandwidth could be further increased by adding more subsections with 30% bandwidth obtained when the profile is based on 4 sections. The operation of the horn is based on generating higher order modes at the correct amplitude ratio and phase with respect to the incident TE11 mode in the circular waveguide, which is achieved by accurate determination of the magnitude and location of the flare steps. This in turn yields a field distribution at the horn aperture that has low sidelobes and cross polarization in the radiation pattern. A key component in the design package is the optimization software that searches for the correct magnitude and location of the flare discontinuities. We have generated a software package based on the combination of modal matching, genetic algorithm (GA) and simplex optimization. The genetic code is first used to locate the proximity of the global minimum. The set of parameters obtained are then used as a starting point for the simplex method, which refines the parameters to the required accuracy.

As well as those receivers, we consider to use a corrugated horn for the ALMA band 10 (787-950 GHz) receiver. To characterize the performance of fabricated horns experimentally, we developed a phase and amplitude antenna test system. The signal source consists of a W-band Gunn oscillator followed by a nonupler with an open waveguide probe on an X-Y-Z-theta translation stage. A corrugated horn is attached to a subharmonic Schottky diode mixer pumped by another W-band Gunn oscillator. Both Gunn oscillators are phase-locked to a single microwave reference at around 16 GHz, but on different sideband. The IF of 90 MHz is passed to a lock-in amplifier that measures phase and amplitude. Figure 1 shows preliminary results of the near field beam pattern (at 826 GHz) of a corrugated horn made by conventional electro-forming. The far-field beam pattern calculated from the phase and amplitude data showed good agreement with the theoretical one.

The details of the structure and evolution of the universe are believed to be encoded in the anisotropy of the CMB. It is believed that the direct evidence of the inflationary epoch - the rapid expansion of the universe after the Big Bang - lies in the traces of gravitational waves in the CMB, which manifests in the temperature anisotropy and polarization of the CMB. If inflationary gravitational waves do indeed exist, they will be the oldest relic of the universe, created 500,000 years before the CMB was emitted. The measurement of the CMB polarization - the B-mode polarization in particular - will be the indirect proof of the existence of the inflationary gravitational waves and will give insight into the epoch of inflation. Cryogenic detectors currently in use for CMB instrumentation are sensitive enough to reach the photon noise limit which is governed by the photon arrival statistics and depends on the intensity of the background radiation. CMB space missions offer the opportunity to reach fundamental cosmic background limits, and therefore, further improvements in the detector sensitivity is not helpful. The only avenue available for improving the overall experimental sensitivity for a wide field survey is to increase the throughput, which simply corresponds to capturing more photons. The only way that will be possible is to increase the number of detectors. As a result, future CMB experiments are expected to require large focal planes with thousands of detectors. For CMB experiments, the field of view of each detector is restricted in order to reduce the pickup of stray radiation. Currently, the collimation of the incoming beam is achieved using metal feedhorns. Though feedhorns have excellent performance, their mass, size, and expense make them unsuitable for large arrays. A highly desirable solution to these problems would be to fabricate monolithic array of antenna-coupled detectors on a planar substrate. In this paper, we describe a novel dual-polarization planar slot antenna array concept which produces quite a narrow (F/4) beam with no additional optical coupling elements such as substrate lens or micro- machined horns. The design, simulation, and preliminary measurement of the antenna array will be presented."

The advent of such a system will provide an order of magnitude increase in mapping speed over what is now available and revolutionize how observational astronomy is performed in this important wavelength regime. SuperCam is constructed by stacking eight, 1x8 rows of tunerless, SIS mixers. The SIS junctions use SOI (Silicon on Insulator) technology, with beamleads for device positioning and IF and ground electrical connections. The mixer modules are fabricated using a Kern MMP-2522 micromilling machine purchased specifically for this task. The IF output of each SIS device is directly connected to a low-noise, broadband MMIC amplifier module integrated into the mixer block. The instantaneous IF bandwidth of each pixel is 2 GHz, with a center frequency of 5 GHz. An IF processor constructed of eight 8-channel modules provides IF amplification, total power monitoring and baseband downconversion. A spectrum of the central 250 MHz or 500 MHz of each IF band is provided by the Omnisys real-time FFT spectrometer system, based on Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGAs. This spectrometer can operate in either 32 channel mode (500 MHz/channel) or 64 channel mode (250 MHz/channel).

TELIS is a collaborative European project to develop a three-channel heterodyne balloon-based spectrometer for measuring a variety of atmospheric constituents of the stratosphere. The Superconducting Integrated Receiver (SIR) comprises in one chip a planar antenna integrated with an SIS mixer, a superconducting Flux Flow Oscillator (FFO) acting as Local Oscillator (LO) and a second SIS harmonic mixer (HM) for the FFO phase locking. As a result of the FFO design optimization a free-running linewidth between 9 and 1.5 MHz has been measured in the frequency range 500 - 710 GHz resulting in phase-locking of 35 to 95 % of the FFO power correspondingly. A new generation of the SIR devices with improved FFO performance and optimized interface between FFO and SIS/HM has been developed and comprehensively tested; all required TELIS parameters were demonstrated. Phase-locked FFO operation over entire SIR channel frequency range has been realized, spectral resolution below 1 MHz has been confirmed by gas cell and CW signal measurements. An uncorrected double side band (DSB) noise temperature about 200 K has been measured with the phase-locked FFO. The intermediate frequency bandwidth 4-8 GHz has been realized. To ensure remote operation of the phase-locked SIR several procedures for its automatic computer control have been developed and tested. To overcome temperature constraints and extend operation frequency of the all-Nb SIR we have developed and studied Nb-AlN-NbN-Nb circuits with a gap voltage Vg up to 3.7 mV and extremely low leakage currents (Rj/Rn > 30). Based on these junctions integrated microcircuits comprising FFO and harmonic mixer have been designed, fabricated and tested; the radiation from such circuits has been measured at frequencies up to 700 GHz. Employment of NbN electrode does not result in the appearance of additional noise. For example, FFO linewidth as low as 1 MHz was measured at 600 GHz, that allows us to phase lock up to 92 % of the emitted by FFO power and realize very low phase noise about -90 dBc. Preliminary results demonstrated uncorrected DSB noise temperature of the Nb-AlN-NbN SIR below 250 K at frequencies of primary TELIS interest around 500 and 600 GHz. We expect that Nb-AlN-NbN-Nb device will be used for the first qualification TELIS flight that is scheduled on April 2007."

We report on detection of electromagnetic radiation at about 500 GHz from current-biased intrinsic Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 single crystal Josephson junctions1. We used two silicon lenses to quasi-optically couple radiation from our samples to an integrated superconducting heterodyne receiver. The samples were prepared in a step-like geometry, by defining a mesa in the shape of bow-tie antenna using electron beam lithography and argon ion milling on the upper surface of the crystal. The microwave radiation was detected by a low-noise all-superconducting heterodyne receiver. The receiver consists of an SIS mixer integrated on the single chip with a superconducting flux-flow oscillator acting as a local oscillator. From our data we can identify the emission of individual intrinsic Josephson junctions from a stack consisting of over 100 junctions. The estimated maximum Josephson radiation power which reached the receiver antenna was about 1 pW. We suppose that the possibility of mutual phase locking of a large number of stacked junctions strongly depends on several factors such as spread in junction parameters, heating effects, and presence of an external magnetic field. For their frequency locking, series-connected junctions biased by the same current need to have a very small spread in resistances. This requirement seems hard to achieve even in very uniform stacks due to unavoidable resistance changes induced by the dissipated heat."

Dengler","Lee",NULL,"12","286","0","2007","Terahertz heterodyne receivers using Schottky diode mixers are desirable because they require no cryogenic cooling, have intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidths greater than or equal to 20 GHz, and can deliver usefully low noise performance. However, to achieve optimal conversion gain and noise temperature, Schottky receivers operating in the THz range require at least several milliwatts of continuous local oscillator (LO) power. For this reason, the most common THz LO source used for Schottky receivers is the CO2-pumped molecular gas laser. Of clear interest is the possibility of replacing the tube-based molecular gas laser with a solid-state THz LO source capable of pumping a Schottky mixer. To date the only solid-state source capable of producing > 1 mW of continuous wave power above ~ 2 THz is the quantum cascade laser (QCL). THz QCLs have been shown to work as good LO sources for superconducting HEB mixers,  which require significantly less LO power than Schottky mixers. Frequency down-conversion has also been accomplished using two QCL lines and a point-contact Schottky diode. We will report on the operation of a monolithic planar Schottky diode receiver using a THz QCL. The Schottky mixer consists of a Ti/Pt/Au anode contacting a GaAs membrane and is packaged into a waveguide block with an integral horn antenna. The details of the mixer design, construction, and packaging are described in Refs. 3 and 4. At 2.5 THz, the minimum noise temperature of the packaged receiver was about 11,000 K. Although the design of the receiver was optimized for 2.5 THz, good responsivity and measurable noise temperature were obtained for this receiver at frequencies up to 3.1 THz. Using the 2.9 THz deuterated methanol line from a molecular gas laser, the receiver showed a noise temperature of ~ 30,000 K, using 6 mW of LO power in a 25 mm diameter Gaussian beam coupled to the receiver input mirror. Preliminary measurements using a 2.8 THz surface-plasmon guided QCL in place of a molecular gas laser have been made. The QCL emitted a total power of ~ 2 mW in a non-Gaussian divergent beam. After collecting and collimating this beam using an off-axis paraboloid mirror, there was insufficient LO power coupled to the receiver input mirror to generate a measurable noise temperature. However, the receiver did show that when the QCL was driven past a threshold current bias, its output split into two modes spaced 12.8 GHz apart, generating a clear 12.8 GHz IF signal in the receiver. The width of this IF signal indicated that the linewidth of the free-running QCL emission was less than or equal to 10 kHz. We will present further studies on receiver operation with better coupling of QCL light and higher power QCLs."

Its performance potential was initially evaluated with simulations using a hydrodynamic device model and excellent performance characteristics were predicted around 160 GHz and 320 GHz. The validity of the hydrodynamic model at higher submillimeter-wave frequencies is questionable. Therefore, an energy-momentum model was employed more recently together with refined GaN material parameters and heterojunction intrabandtunneling injection characteristics. These simulations predicted RF output power levels (and corresponding dc-to-RF conversion efficiencies) of more than 25 mW (> 2%) at 260-360 GHz and more than 5 mW (> 1%) at 350-490 GHz for operating active-layer temperatures well below 600 K. Power combining is a well-known method if power levels higher than those of a single oscillator are needed in systems applications. Its viability and strong performance potential with milliwatts of output power was demonstrated for the first time at submillimeter-wave frequencies using InP Gunn devices. In these initial experiments, the performance of the in-line waveguide combiner was limited by the fixed spacing between the two oscillators. More recently, waveguide washers were used to adjust the spacing and get closer to the optimum phase relationships at the fundamental and second-harmonic frequencies of the InP Gunn devices in the two cavities. Initial experiments already yielded a performance improvement of 25% and combined power levels of more than 7.5 mW with corresponding combining efficiencies of more than 85% were measured at 280 GHz. These experiments together with earlier experiments at lower frequencies indicate that this a very promising method to increase the output power levels from various NDR devices at submillimeter-wave frequencies including the GaN-based devicesdescribed above."
