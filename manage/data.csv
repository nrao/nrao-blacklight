"2009006000","Evaluation of ALMA Band 8 S/N01 Cartridge","Y. Sekimoto, Y. Iizuka, T. Ito, K. Kumagai, N. Satou, M. Kamikura, Y. Serizawa, N. Naruse, Y. Niizeki, Y. Fujimoto, and W. L. Shan","M1","6","2009","ALMA Band 8 (385 - 500 GHz) is one of frequency bands which cover atmospheric windows on the Atacama desert in the northern Chile. We have developed a cartridge-type receiver which receives two orthogonal polarizations and down-converts the sideband separated signals to intermediate frequencies (IF) between 4 and 8 Wiz. A vvaveguide polarization splitter or ortho-mode transducer (OMT) has been developed, which enables the cryogenic optics quite simple. It achieved low loss of-O.4 dB at 4 K and polarization isolation of -25 dB in 385 - 500 GHz [1]. A sideband separating mixer consists of two DSB Nb-based SIS mixers and vvaveguide quadrature coupler [2]. The receiver noise temperature was less than 8 hf/k or 196 K in SSl3 and the image rejection ratio of > 10 dB in the 90 % of ALMA Band 8 frequency. Gain compression of this receiver was measured. The amplitude and phase stabilities were confirmed to comply the ALMA specifications. The co-polar and cross polar beam patterns of this receiver were measured in five frequencies [3]. Test results of S/N 01 cartridge will be presented."
"2009007011","Series Production of State-of-the-Art 602-720 GHz SIS Receivers for Band 9 of ALMA","B. D. Jackson, R. Hesper, J. Adema, J. Barkhof, A. M. Baryshev,T. Zijlstra, S. Zhu, and T. M. Klapwijk","M1","7","2009","The Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) requires the development and production of 73 state-of-the-art receivers for the 602-720 GHz range - the ALMA Band 9 cartridges. Development and \"pre-production\" of the first 8 cartridges was completed between 2003 and 2008, resulting in a cartridge design that meets the project's challenging requirements. The cartridge design remains essentially unchanged for production, while the production and test processes developed during pre-production have been fine-tuned to address the biggest new challenge for this phase - ramping up production to a rate of 2 cartridges per month over 2009-2012."
"2009012000","Development of the 787-950 GHz ALMA Band 10 Cartridge","Y. Uzawa, T. Kojima1, M. Kroug, M. Takeda, M. Candotti, Y. Fujii, W.-L. Shan, K. Kaneko, S.Shitov, and M.-J. Wang","M1","12","2009","We are developing the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 10 (787-950 GHz) receiver cartridge. The incoming beam from the 12-m antenna is reflected by a pair of two ellipsoidal mirrors placed in the cartridge, and then split into two orthogonal polarizations by a free-standing wire-grid. Each beam enters a corrugated feed horn attached to a double-side-band (DSB) mixer block. The mixer uses a full-height waveguide and an NbTiN- or NbN-based superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer chip. We are testing the following three types of mixer chips: 1) Nb SIS junctions + NbTiN/SiO2/Al tuning circuits on a quartz substrate, 2) Nb SIS junctions + NbN/SiO2/Al tuning circuits on an MgO substrate, and 3) NbN SIS junctions + NbN or NbTiN tuning circuits on an MgO substrate. The IF system uses a 4-12-GHz cooled low-noise InP-based MMIC amplifier developed by Caltech. So far, the type 1) has shown the best performance. At LO frequencies from 800 to 940 GHz, the mixer noise temperatures measured by using the standard Y-factor method were below 240 K at an operating physical temperature of 4 K. The lowest noise temperature, 169 K, was obtained at the center frequency of the band 10, as designed. These well-developed technologies will be implemented in the band 10 cartridge to achieve the ALMA specifications."
"2009014018","230 GHz sideband-separating mixer array","Doris Maier","M2","14","2009","Since 2001 the HEterodyne Receiver Array, HERA, is installed at IRAM's 30m telescope in Spain. It consists of two arrays with 3x3 pixels for two orthogonal polarizations. The receiver is equipped with SSB backshort mixers covering an RF frequency range from 218 to 267 GHz with an IF band of 3.5 to 4.5 GHz. In the near future IRAM will replace this receiver by a new dual-polarization multi-beam receiver with 7x7 pixels. The receiver will be equipped with sideband-separating mixers covering an RF frequency range from 200 to 280 GHz with an IF band from 4 to 12 GHz. The RF quadrature couplers as well as the LO couplers will be realized as branchguide couplers and be integrated with the mixer blocks into one E-plane split-block. The DSB mixers will use Nb junction technology and the IF couplers will be custom made for the use at cryogenic temperatures. This paper presents the concept of the new array as well as the designs of the DSB mixers and the different couplers."
"2009019023","ALMA Band 5 (163-211 GHz) Sideband Separation Mixer","Bhushan Billade, Victor Belitsky, Alexey Pavolotsky, Igor Lapkin, and Jacob Kooi","M2","19","2009","We present the design of ALMA Band 5 sideband separation SIS mixer and experimental results for the double side band mixer and first measurement results 2SB mixer. In this mixer, the LO injection circuitry is integrated on the mixer substrate using a directional coupler, combining microstrip lines with slot-line branches in the ground plane. The isolated port of the LO coupler is terminated by wideband floating elliptical termination. The mixer employs two SIS junctions with junction area of 3 micro m2 each, in the twin junction configuration, followed by a quarter wave transformer to match the RF probe. 2SB mixer uses two identical but mirrored chips, whereas each DSB mixer has the same end-piece configuration. The 2S mixer has modular design such that DSB mixers are measured independently and then integrated into 2SB simply by placing around the middle piece. Measurements of the DSB mixer show noise temperature of around 40K over the entire band. 2SB mixer is not fully characterized yet, however, preliminary measurement indicates SSB (un-corrected) noise temperature of 80K."
"2009024030","Development of SIS Mixers for SMA 400-520 GHz Band","Chao-Te Li, Tse-Jun Chen, Tong-Liang Ni, Wei-Chun Lu, Chuang-Ping Chiu, Chong-Wen Chen, Yung-Chin Chang, Ming-Jye Wang, and Sheng-Cai Shi","M2","24","2009","SIS junction mixers were developed for SMA 400-520 GHz band. The results show receiver noise temperature around 100 K across the band, with noise contribution from RF loss and IF estimated to be around 50 K and 20K, respectively. Two schemes were used to tune out junction's parasitic capacitance. When a parallel inductor is employed, the input impedance is close to Rn, which facilitates impedance matching between the junction and the waveguide probe. Waveguide probes were designed to achieve a low feed-point impedance to match to the junction resistance. Optimum embedding impedances for lower receiver noise temperature were investigated. Performances of two schemes and composition of receiver noise were also discussed."

Walker, G. de Lange, T. Klapwijk, T. Zijlstra, H. Mani, and S. Weinreb","M2","31","2009","We have constructed an 810 GHz receiver system incorporating a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer developed for Band-3 of the HIFI instrument for Herschel space observatory and a wide-band SiGe low noise amplifier (LNA) designed at Caltech. The instrument is currently installed at the RLT telescope (elevation 5500 m) in northern Chile. Hot/cold (280K/72K) load measurements performed at the telescope yield noise temperatures of 225 K (Y-factor = 1.7) including receiver optics. First-light observations indicate that the receiver is highly sensitive and functions stably. We present details of the receiver system, its performance at the telescope, and first-light observations with the Herschel mixer."
"2009035000","Broadband SIS mixer for 1 THz Band","A. Karpov, D. Miller, J. A. Stern, B. Bumble, H. G. LeDuc, J. Zmuidzinas","M2","35","2009","We report the development of a low noise and broadband SIS mixer aimed for 1 THz channel of the Caltech Airborne Submillimeter Interstellar Medium Investigations Receiver (CASIMIR), designed for the Stratospheric Observatory for Far Infrared Astronomy, (SOFIA). The mixer uses an array of 0.24 micro m2 Nb/Al-AlN/NbTiN SIS junctions with critical current density of 30-50 KA/cm2. The junctions are shaped in order to optimize the suppression of the Josephson DC currents. We are using a double slot planar antenna to couple the mixer chip with the telescope beam. The RF matching microcircuit is made using Nb and gold films. The mixer IF circuit is designed to cover 4 - 8 GHz band. A test receiver with the new mixer has a low noise operation in a 0.87 - 1.12 THz band. The minimum DSB receiver noise measured at 1 THz is 260 K (Y=1.64), apparently the lowest reported up to date. The receiver noise corrected for the loss in the LO injection beam splitter and in the cryostat window is 200 K. The combination of a broad operation band of about 250 GHz with a low receiver noise is making the new mixer a useful element for application at SOFIA. We will discuss the prospective of a further improvement of the sensitivity and extension of the upper frequency of operation of SIS mixer."
"2009037000","Terahertz Local Oscillator Sources","T.W. Crowe, J.L. Hesler, W.L. Bishop, G.S. Schoenthal, and K. Hui","M3","37","2009","High quality local oscillator sources are required for astronomical receivers throughout the terahertz frequency range. This paper is focused on the development of sources for frequencies greater than 1 THz for use with Hot Electron Bolometric (HEB) mixers, specifically on the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). One of the great advantages of HEB mixers is their very low LO power requirements, of order one microwatt per pixel (including coupling losses). However, the challenges of achieving even this power level at such high frequency remain significant, and the goals for significant tuning bands to enhance the measurement capability of the receiver are formidable. Also, there is great interest in developing array receivers, which will increase the required power level by a factor of ten. VDI's terahertz sources are based on high power amplifiers, typically near 40GHz, and a series of frequency multipliers that translate the power to higher frequency, albeit with very significant losses. For example, three years ago VDI (in collaboration with SRON) presented a 1.3THz source that generated of order 10uW and was electronically tunable over 100GHz of bandwidth. This source used an amp/x2x2x3x3 configuration, where the doublers were high power varactors and the triplers were broadband varistor multipliers. In fact, the triplers were shown to operate with similar performance across the entire waveguide band (1.1-1.7THz) without any tuning whatsoever. These same triplers have been used to generate greater than 30uW, when stronger driver components have been used. More recently VDI has focused on the 1.9 and 2.7THz bands that are of interest for the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz Frequencies, which is being developed by the Max-Planck-Institut fuer Radioastronomie (MPIfR) and the Universitaet zu Koeln for use on the SOFIA aircraft. At 1.9 THz VDI has delivered an initial LO chain that generates a few microwatts of power, which is marginally sufficient to pump the receiver when the coupling losses into the dewar are included. In this paper VDI will describe this LO chain and the ongoing efforts to increase the output power by an order of magnitude for use on a future receiver array. The 2.7 THz frequency band is significantly more challenging, owing to the increased inefficiency of Schottky multipliers at the higher frequency. The goal is to generate enough power for a single pixel receiver with significant frequency tuning. To date VDI has demonstrated the required driver module at 300GHz and is presently working on an improved tripler to 900GHz. The final tripler to 2.7THz has been designed and is awaiting fabrication. First results for the new components are expected to be available in time for the conference presentation."
