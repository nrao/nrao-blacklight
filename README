This NRAO Blacklight is different!  The Solr here is a special build using
field collapsing via patch SOLR-236 against Solr 1.4.0 in Apr 2010.

I tried the SOLR-236 field collapsing patch back in April, which increased
query response time by 2-3 orders of magnitude, O(msec) to O(sec).  This was
using an index of 500k documents which in general collapsed down to about 5k
records.

I was able to use Blacklight 2.4 for field collapsing SOLR-236 without too much
trouble.  I simply added a block to the catalog controller which created a
`collapsed` hash from fields already present in `response`.  Then I used
`collapse` in the template.  The collapsed documents were there in `response`
without modification albeit quite nested.

As an alternative, the Sep 2010 demo of VLA/EVLA used vanilla Solr 1.4.0
multiValued fields for the collapsed portion of the Solr documents, which kept
query response time in the millisecond range.

Any thoughts on performance in Solr 4.0's field collapsing?
